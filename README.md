# Locked With Me

A **local co-op horror game for Android** built in Unity with C#.  
Playable in **singleplayer** or **local co-op**, the game challenges players to escape a locked house, survive AI enemies and ultimately destroy the dam trapping them on an island.

## Overview

Originally a small university assignment, I expanded it into a fully playable mobile game.  
**Problem:** Delivering AI, networking and atmosphere on limited Android hardware.  
**Method:** Implemented dynamic AI (sound/sight states), Mirror Networking for local co-op and mobile-focused optimizations (LOD, occlusion culling, progressive world loading).  
**Outcome:** A polished 10–15 minute horror game that runs smoothly on Android devices.
